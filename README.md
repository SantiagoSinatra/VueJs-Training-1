#### Description
This is the first time I used Vue.js feel free to check each commit because some of them hold important notes I took and also hold other functionality that (in order to follow the course) I had to delete or change. <br>The end result that you will see if you clone the last commit is an array of buttons that when clicked trigger and `emit` function that adds the selected numbers to an array called `clickedNumbers`and then displays them below the `Clicked numbers` h3.

### project-2
#### Description
This is a simple two input form that validates two different fields one for the username and the other for a password.<br>The **username** is required and must have at least 5 characters. This is validated using a method inside the input component that requires two props:
- **rules** that are like flags that indicate what kind of validation is needed.
- **value** that is the value of the input.<br>
After the value is validated if there is an error a string with the end result of the validation is returned inside a computed property **error()** and then this is echoed in the template for the user to see.<br> This input is also has another method **input()** that is in charge of emmiting the value and the validation to another method **update()** in its parent this is used to enable or disable the input button preventing the user from submitting a wrong form.
