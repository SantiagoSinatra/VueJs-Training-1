#### Description
This is the first time I used Vue.js feel free to check each commit because some of them hold important notes I took and also hold other functionality that (in order to follow the course) I had to delete or change. <br>The end result that you will see if you clone the last commit is an array of buttons that when clicked trigger and `emit` function that adds the selected numbers to an array called `clickedNumbers`and then displays them below the `Clicked numbers` h3.
